# bamazon

Welcome to my bamazon app.

The point of this assignment is to create an amzonesque app.  Users can peruse through a databse of products, and make purchases.
The bamazon will keep track of the purchases made and remove what was purchased from the inventory. 

Tables within the Database will include each product, with a unique and incrementing id.
Also, they will include information about each product. For instance, the price, department in which the item is located, and how much/many of the item is in stock.

Adding to the app a management function in which data can be changed by adding to the inventory and collecting of funds is another goal.
